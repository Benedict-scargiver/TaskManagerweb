## Overview

As a software engineer, On this my primary projects has involved developing a task management web dashboard. I created a task management web dashboard that enables users to log in and out with ease while employing session checks that leverage local storage for improved satisfaction, view and complete tasks also from local shorage with strike-through indicators and toast alerts, and add new tasks, all with a responsive UI styled using custom CSS. all while working with a responsive user interface that has been carefully styled using custom CSS to provide an aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly environment. My intent while working on this project is to considerably advance my web development skills, especially with NextJS 15, as I carefully prepare for subsequent modules that will be centered around expert topics such as Cloud Databases.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000] with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my editor,
and NextJS 15 for the framework
TypeScript for type safety .
I downloaded the dependencies with npm, used Git/GitHub for version control, and tested the app in the browser with responsive design adjustments.
